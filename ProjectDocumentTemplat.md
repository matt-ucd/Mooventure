# Game Basic Information #

## Summary ##

**A paragraph-length pitch for your game.**

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. It is encouraged to explain the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy.**


**If you did work that should be factored in to your grade that does not fit easily into the proscribed roles, add it here! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least 4 such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The background of the game consists of procedurally-generated terrain that is produced with Perlin noise. This terrain can be modified by the game at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## User Interface

**Describe your user interface and how it relates to gameplay. This can be done via the template.**
We created our own UI kit to fit in the idea and the goal of our game better. Since our game are designed to happen on the campus of UC Davis, and we are trying to introduce 
the buildings and fun places on campus, we decided to use cow-print and the orange and blue shade colors that mimics the UC Davis gold and Aggie blue as our theme colors. 
The frames of the UI windows are designed with cow-print, while the buttons are in gold and Aggie blue to make the scenes look more vivid.

In the level (gameplay) scene, we have a distance bar on the top left to show the distance the player moved towards the goal place. In this way, the player can easily know 
how far they need to go to hit the goal place. At the same time, there is a timer on the top right to limit the time for the player. The pause button allows the player to stop 
in the middle of the game and resume later.

The button icons and player icons are designed to match the cow-print black and white color theme. The fonts of the texts are from Dafont.com, and we chose the ones with a 
hand-written style to make the game feel more casual and fun. All texts are designed to have a white highlight and a black shadow in the back to create a pop-up effect, which 
makes it clearer to read.

## Movement/Physics

**Describe the basics of movement and physics in your game. Is it the standard physics model? What did you change or modify? Did you make your movement scripts that do not use the physics system?**

## Animation and Visuals

**List your assets including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe how your work intersects with game feel, graphic design, and world-building. Include your visual style guide if one exists.**

## Input

**Describe the default input configuration.**

**Add an entry for each platform or input style your project supports.**

## Game Logic

**Document what game states and game data you managed and what design patterns you used to complete your task.**

# Sub-Roles

## Audio

**List your assets including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe the implementation of your audio system.**

**Document the sound style.** 

## Gameplay Testing

**Add a link to the full results of your gameplay tests.**

**Summarize the key findings from your gameplay tests.**

## Narrative Design

**Document how the narrative is present in the game via assets, gameplay systems, and gameplay.** 

## Press Kit and Trailer

**Include links to your presskit materials and trailer.**

**Describe how you showcased your work. How did you choose what to show in the trailer? Why did you choose your screenshots?**



## Game Feel

**Document what you added to and how you tweaked your game to improve its game feel.**
1. We consciously noticed that it would be helpful to have a introduction and a brief tutorial before the game starts. However, we debated about how to encourage the players 
to watch the tutorial. We thought about having an attention-attracting "intro" button or giving a forced tutorial at the beginning. After discussions, we decided to add a 
pop-up window at the beginning, where when you click on the "start" button, it will ask you to go over an introduction. After you finished it or skipped it, you can still 
access it by clicking on the "intro" button later. This helps the player to get a better overview of our game backgrounds and how they should play the game.

2. The player was designed to "die" if she is hurt by the turkey. However, it might be too frustrating if the player is not familiar with the attack technic. So we decided to 
change the interaction mechanism between the player and the turkey. Instead of dying directly, we added a "freeze" mechanism, in which the player would be not able to move 
forward for a certain time if she is hurt by the tureky. This mechanism fits well into the game because it is timed, and it also helps the player to survive longer in the game.
